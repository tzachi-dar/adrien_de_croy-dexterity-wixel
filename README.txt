Pololu Wixel Software Development Kit (SDK)

This package contains code and Makefiles that will help you create
your own applications for the Pololu Wixel.  The Wixel is a general-
purpose programmable module featuring a 2.4 GHz radio and USB.  The
Wixel is based on the CC2511F32 microcontroller from Texas Instruments,
which has an integrated radio transceiver, 32 KB of flash memory, 4 KB
of RAM, and a full-speed USB interface.

For documentation of this SDK, see:

(You can also generate the documentation yourself by running
Doxygen on libraries/Doxyfile.)
