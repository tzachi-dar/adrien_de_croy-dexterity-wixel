/*! \file gpio.h
 *
 * The <code>gpio.lib</code> library provides functions for using the CC2511's pins
 * as general purpose inputs or outputs (GPIO).  Every pin on the CC2511 that has a
 * name starting with <i>P</i> can be configured as a <i>digital input</i> or <i>digital output</i>.
 *
 * The functions in this library allow for simpler programmatic approaches to working
 * with digital I/O since you no longer have to deal with a multitude of pin-specific
 * registers.
 *
 * \section ports Ports
 *
 * The pins on the CC2511 are divided into three ports: Port 0 (P0), Port 1 (P1),
 * and Port 2 (P2).  Every pin's name is prefixed by the name of the port it is on.
 * For example, P0_3 starts with "P0" so it is a pin on Port 0.
 *
 * On the Wixel, none of the pins on Port 0 and Port 1 are tied to any on-board
 * hardware so they completely free to be used as GPIO.
 *
 * When the Wixel starts up, all the pins on Port 0 and Port 1 will be inputs with
 * internal pull-up resistors enabled <i>except</i> P1_0 and P1_1, which do not have
 * internal pull-up or pull-down resistors
 *
 * This library supports Port 2, but all of the Wixel's Port 2 pins are handled by the
 * functions declared in board.h so you should not need to manipulate them with this
 * library.
 *
 * \section pinparam The pinNumber parameter
 *
 * Most of the functions in this library take a pin number as their first
 * argument.  These numbers are computed by multiplying the first digit in the
 * pin name by ten and adding it to the second digit, as shown in the table below.
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>CC2511 Pins</caption>
 * <tr><th>Pin</th><th>pinNumber parameter</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>P0_0</td><td>0</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>P0_1</td><td>1</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>P0_2</td><td>2</td></tr>

 * \section interrupts Interrupts
 *
 * All the functions in this library are declared as reentrant, which means it is
 * safe to call them in your main loop and also in your interrupt service routines
 * (ISRs).
 * However, if you are using these functions in an ISR, you should make sure that you
 * have no code in your main loop that does a non-atomic read-modify-write operation
 * on any of the I/O registers that are changed in the interrupt.
 * The risk is that the interrupt could fire after while the read-modify-write
 * operation is in progress, after the register has been read but before it has been
 * written.  Then when the register is written by the main loop, the change made by
 * the ISR will be unintentionally lost.
 *
 * For example, it would be bad if you called <code>setDigitalOutput(10, 1)</code>
 * in an interrupt and in your main loop you had some code like:
\code
P1DIR = (P1DIR & MASK) | VALUE;
\endcode
 *
 * It is OK to have code like <code>P1DIR |= VALUE;</code> in your main loop because
 * that compiles to a single instruction, so it should be atomic.
 *
 * \section overhead Overhead
 *
 * Calling the functions in this library will be slower than manipulating the I/O
 * registers yourself, but the overhead should be roughly the same for each pin.
 *
 * This library (git revision 4de9ee1f) was tested with
 * SDCC 3.0.0 (#6037) and it was found that an I/O line could be toggled once
 * every 3.2 microseconds by calling setDigitalOutput() several times in a row.
 *
 * \section caveats Caveats
 *
 * To use your digital I/O pins correctly, there are several things you should be aware of:
 * - <b>Maximum voltage ratings:</b> Be sure to not expose your input pins to voltages
 *   outside their allowed range.  The voltage should not go below 0 V (GND) and should
 *   not exceed VDD (typically 3.3 V).  This means that you can not connect an input
 *   on the CC2511 directly to an output from a 5V system if the output ever drives
 *   high (5 V).  You can use a voltage divider circuit, level-shifter, or diode to
 *   overcome this limitation.
 * - <b>Drawing too much current from an output pin:</b> Be sure you do not attempt
 *   to draw too much current from your output pin; it may break.
 *   The amount of current that can be supplied by the CC2511's I/O pins is not
 *   well-documented by the manufacturer.  According to
 *   <a href="http://e2e.ti.com/support/low_power_rf/f/155/p/31555/319919.aspx">this forum post by a TI Employee</a>,
 *   regular I/O pins are designed to be able to source 4&nbsp;mA while P1_0 and P1_1 are designed for 20 mA.
 *   You can use a transistor to overcome this limitation.
 * - <b>Shorts</b>: Be sure that you do not connect a high output pin directly to a
 *   low output pin or to another high output pin that is driving to a different voltage.
 * - <b>Peripheral functions</b>: Many of the pins on the CC2511 can be configured to
 *   be used by a peripheral by setting the right bit in the P0SEL, P1SEL, or P2SEL
 *   register.  When a pin is being used by a peripheral, the functions in this
 *   library may not work.  For example, if you have enabled USART1 in Alternate
 *   Location 1, then you can not control the output value of P1_6 using these
 *   functions because P1_6 serves as the serial transmit (TX) line.

- #PULLED (1): Enables an internal 20 kilohm pull-up or pull-down resistor on the pin.
  The type of resistor used is set at the port level.  By default, Port 0 and Port 1
  use pull-up resistors, but you can change those ports to use pull-down resistors
  calling setPort0PullType() or setPort1PullType().  You can not have pull-up and

This function first sets the pull type, then it sets the pin direction.

\code
P1SEL &= ~(1<<5);
P1DIR &= ~(1<<5);
\endcode

Note: The pins P1_0 and P1_1 do NOT have internal pull-up or pull-down resistors,
so the second argument to this function does not have any effect when configuring
either of those pins.
