 * There are only 256 bytes of Fast Access Ram, so use this qualifier sparingly.
 *
 * Besides being faster, another advantage of DATA over XDATA is the ability to do atomic
 * operations.  The 8051 instruction set supports several instructions
 * (INC, DEC, ORL, ANL, XRL) that let you read, modify, and write a single byte of internal
 * RAM with one instruction.
