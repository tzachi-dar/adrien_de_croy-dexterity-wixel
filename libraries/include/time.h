/*! \file time.h
 * This module helps you keep track of time in milliseconds.
 * Calling timeInit() sets up a timer (Timer 4) to overflow every millisecond
 * (approximately).
 * You can read the time at any time by calling getMs().
 * For the interrupt to work, you must write
 * <pre>include <time.h></pre>
 * or
 * <pre>include <wixel.h></pre>
 * in the source file that contains your main() function.
 * Also, you must call boardClockInit() or else the timing will
 * be wrong.
 *
 * Both boardClockInit() and timeInit() are called from systemInit(), so you
 * can simply call systemInit() to initialize everything.
